# Legacy Files

This directory contains legacy files from the original FHEM implementation and development utilities.

## Files

- **00_THZ.pm**: The original FHEM module by Immi that this Home Assistant integration is based on. Kept for reference and to honor the original work.

- **000_mapping_parser.py**: A utility script used during development for parsing register mappings from the original FHEM module.

These files are preserved for historical reference and to acknowledge the foundation this integration was built upon.
