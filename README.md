## Introduction

This is a custom Home Assistant integration for connecting Stiebel Eltron LWZ or Tecalor THZ heat pumps to Home Assistant. The integration enables comprehensive monitoring and control of your heat pump system directly from your Home Assistant instance.

The integration communicates with the heat pump using the serial protocol, supporting both direct USB connections and network-based serial connections (via ser2net). This allows flexible deployment options depending on your home automation setup.

**Origin**: This integration is based on the FHEM-Module developed by Immi, adapted for Home Assistant with modern async architecture and full UI configuration support.

## Features

### Currently Implemented

- ✅ **Full UI Configuration**: Easy setup through Home Assistant's integration interface - no YAML configuration required
- ✅ **Connection Options**: Support for both USB serial and network (ser2net) connections
- ✅ **Sensor Platform**: Monitor various heat pump parameters (temperatures, pressures, operating states, etc.)
- ✅ **Binary Sensor Platform**: Monitor alarm/error states, compressor status, heating mode, and defrost status
- ✅ **Climate Platform**: Direct temperature control for heating circuits with preset modes (comfort/eco)
- ✅ **Switch Platform**: Control heat pump functions on/off
- ✅ **Number Platform**: Adjust numeric settings and parameters
- ✅ **Select Platform**: Choose between predefined options for various settings
- ✅ **Time Platform**: Set time-based parameters
- ✅ **Calendar Platform**: View heating schedules and programs
- ✅ **Device Registry Integration**: Proper device identification in Home Assistant
- ✅ **Automatic Polling**: Regular updates of sensor values
- ✅ **Smart Entity Management**: Non-essential entities are hidden by default to reduce clutter
- ✅ **Long-term Statistics**: Sensors support state_class for energy dashboard integration
- ✅ **Diagnostics Support**: Built-in diagnostics for troubleshooting connection and device issues

### Hidden Entities by Default

To provide a cleaner initial setup experience, the following entity types are hidden by default:

- **HC2 (Heating Circuit 2) entities**: Only needed if you have a second heating circuit installed
- **Time plan/program entities**: Advanced schedule configuration entities (programDHW_*, programHC1_*, programHC2_*)
- **Advanced technical parameters**: Parameters like gradient, hysteresis, integral components (typically p13 and higher)

**Note**: Hidden entities can still be manually enabled through the Home Assistant UI:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Find the THZ integration and click on it
3. Click on the device
4. Click "Show disabled entities" at the bottom
5. Enable any entities you need

### New in v0.1.0

#### Climate Entity
The integration now includes a climate entity for each heating circuit (HC1 and HC2 if available), providing:
- Direct temperature control from Home Assistant's climate interface
- Support for comfort and eco preset modes
- Integration with Home Assistant automations and climate cards
- Automatic synchronization with heat pump settings

#### Binary Sensors
New binary sensors provide real-time monitoring of critical system states:
- **Alarm/Error/Warning**: Immediate notification of system issues
- **Compressor Running**: Monitor compressor operation status
- **Heating Mode**: Track when heating is active
- **DHW Mode**: Monitor domestic hot water heating
- **Defrost Active**: Know when defrost cycle is running

#### Diagnostics Support
Built-in diagnostics make troubleshooting easier:
- Access via **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **THZ** → **Device** → **Download Diagnostics**
- Includes connection status, firmware version, coordinator states, and entity counts
- Automatically redacts sensitive information (IP addresses, serial numbers)
- Useful for reporting issues and getting support

### Planned Features

- 🔄 Improve Schedule handling
- 🔄 make sure all Sensor values are interpreted correctly
- 🔄 Improve Settings for Polling Frequency from the Device

## Compatibility

### Confirmed Working Devices
